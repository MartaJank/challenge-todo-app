# TODO

This is a simple platform to get record of the tasks you have to do and organize yourself! :ballot_box_with_check:



## How this works?

Simple!

- Add a task by clicking on the button on your homepage.
- Click the name of the task if it's done to cross it.
- Click on details to see the description of the task you previously provided and also get access to edit or delete the task. 





DONE! :smile:
